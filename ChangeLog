plugins:
    include a software called RSEM to estimate abundance of assembled assemblies.

perlLib:
    add a perl script called run_RSEM_align_n_estimate.pl simply maps the familiar parameters 
    used in assembley to those of the RSEM software and then executes RSEM accordingly.

plugins:
    add two scripts:
    *run_abundance_estimation.sh : test abundance estimation using RSEM software.
    *clean.pl : clean those files generated during test Bridger and RSEM.
